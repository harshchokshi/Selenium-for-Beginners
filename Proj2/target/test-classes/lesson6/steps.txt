HOW TO USE PROPERTIES FILE IN SELENIUM?

CREATE PROPERTY FILE
HERE, DataFile.properties IS CREATED

CREATE A CLASS THAT READ DATA FROM PROPERTY FILE
HERE, ReadDataPropertyFile.java IS CREATED

IMPORT PACKAGES
import java.io.File;
import java.io.FileInputStream;
import java.util.Properties;

CREATE A FILE USING FILE CLASS
File file = new File($providepathofcreatepropertyfile$);

READ FROM FILE USING FILE INPUTSTREAM
SINCE FILEINPUTSTREAM THROWS EXCEPTION SO SURROUNDED BY TRY CATCH BLOCK

LOAD ALL THIS PROPERTIES INTO PROPERTY OBJECT
SINCE LOADING MIGHT THROWS EXCEPTION SO SURROUNDED BY TRY CATCH BLOCK

GET THIS PROPERTY THROUGH getProperty(String key) METHOD
